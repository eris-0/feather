# Very brief summary of theory rules:  

## Vowels  

Vowel chords are determined phonetically by lexical set. Some mergers and splits are not accounted for in this readme but will be addressed in the documentation of the completed theory.  
A: "hat", "hard"  
O: "cot", "caught", "sort"  
E: "pet", "there"  
U: "cut", "put", "commA" (weak schwa)*  
EU: "kit", "near", "mornIng" (weak i)*  
*weak vowels can be highly variable depending on accent. The correct vowel chord for a given weak syllable is the one matching whichever strong vowel sounds the closest in your accent, or U in the case of a neutral vowel.  
AE: "they"  
AU: "price", "mouth"  
AEU: "fleece"  
OE: "goat", "goal", "bolt", "cold"  
OU: "goose"  
OEU: "choice"  

The AO chord is never used for phonetic writeouts, leaving it reserved for briefs and such.  

Glides from one vowel sound to another are treated as if only the first vowel is there. Thus the first stroke of "create" uses AEU.  

## Consonants  

Some consonant chords are determined phonetically, others orthographically. In general, the orthographic rules override the phonetic rules (so the 'z' in pizza uses the 'z' chord and not the 'ts' chord)  
For clusters, just overlap the chords. This means many chords stand in for multiple clusters (e.g. DM is both 'n' and 'nd')  
The order does not matter in clusters. The 'rd' of 'hard' and the 'dr' of 'drink' both use DR.  
Currently, yod is completely ignored in clusters including in the case of yod coalescence. Thus the t in 'tube' uses T regardless of whether you pronounce it 'TOOB', 'CHOOB', or 'TYOOB'.  


### Phonetic  
T: t  
F: f  
D: d  
M: m  
S: s, z  
TFDM: b  
FM: sh  
TFM: ch  
SR: g  
TFSR: h  
FDM: j  
TF: k  
MR: l*  
DM: n  
DMSR: ng  
TD: p  
TM: v  
FD: w  
*in some cases where r and l conflict, l uses SR:  
TFDMSR: bl  

### Orthographic
R: r  
TFSR: ll  
TFD: q, ck  
TFS: x  
FMR: y  
TDS: z  
FDR: wr  
FDSR: wh  

## Additional rules
- Use an E in the final stroke of words ending in silent e. 'fate' = "FAE/TE"  
- Use a U in the final stroke of words containing the 'ea' or 'ou' digraph. 'feat' = "FAEU/TU", 'out' = "AU/TU"  
- These rules apply together: 'create' = "TFRAEU/TEU"  
phonetic: shun = FDM  
In the event of a conflict, the AO chord serves the same purpose as the asterisk in normal steno.
