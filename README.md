# Feather Theory

Feather is a 10-key steno theory that can be used one-handed. It is not finished yet, but the progress thus far is presented in this repository. A highly abbreviated cheat sheet of the theory rules is available below; learning resources are planned in the future. Also included are my personal dictionaries; an official starter dictionary is planned in the future.

# How to use:
1. install the stenotype extended plugin
2. From the Plover config folder (accessible via file -> Open config folder in Plover), navigate to plover\plover\plugins\win\Python39\site-packages (assuming windows) and replace extended_stenotype.py with the extended_stenotype.py file from this repo
3. Add the dictionary
4. Get the flamingo.py python dictionary from this repo to use in fingerspelling

# Very brief summary of theory rules:  

## Vowels  

Vowel chords are determined phonetically by lexical set. Some mergers and splits are not accounted for in this readme but will be addressed in the documentation of the completed theory.  
A: "hat", "hard"  
O: "cot", "caught", "sort"  
E: "pet", "there"  
U: "cut", "put", "commA" (weak schwa)*  
EU: "kit", "near", "mornIng" (weak i)*  
*weak vowels can be highly variable depending on accent. The correct vowel chord for a given weak syllable is the one matching whichever strong vowel sounds the closest in your accent, or U in the case of a neutral vowel.  
AE: "they"  
AU: "price", "mouth"  
AEU: "fleece"  
OE: "goat", "goal", "bolt", "cold"  
OU: "goose"  
OEU: "choice"  

The AO chord is never used for phonetic writeouts, leaving it reserved for briefs and such.  

Glides from one vowel sound to another are treated as if only the first vowel is there. Thus the first stroke of "create" uses AEU.  

## Consonants  

Some consonant chords are determined phonetically, others orthographically. In general, the orthographic rules override the phonetic rules (so the 'z' in pizza uses the 'z' chord and not the 'ts' chord)  
For clusters, just overlap the chords. This means many chords stand in for multiple clusters (e.g. DM is both 'n' and 'nd')  
The order does not matter in clusters. The 'rd' of 'hard' and the 'dr' of 'drink' both use DR.  
Currently, yod is completely ignored in clusters including in the case of yod coalescence. Thus the t in 'tube' uses T regardless of whether you pronounce it 'TOOB', 'CHOOB', or 'TYOOB'.  


### Phonetic  
T: t  
F: f  
D: d  
M: m  
S: s, z  
TFDM: b  
FM: sh  
TFM: ch  
SR: g  
DSR: h  
FDM: j  
TF: k  
MR: l*  
DM: n  
DMSR: ng  
TD: p  
TM: v  
FD: w  
*in some cases where r and l conflict, l uses SR:  
TFDMSR: bl  

### Orthographic
R: r  
TFSR: ll  
TFD: q, ck  
TFS: x  
FMR: y  
TDS: z  
FDR: wr  
FDSR: wh  

## Additional rules
- Use an E in the final stroke of words ending in silent e. 'fate' = "FAE/TE"  
- Use a U in the final stroke of words containing the 'ea' or 'ou' digraph. 'feat' = "FAEU/TU", 'out' = "AU/TU"  
- These rules apply together: 'create' = "TFRAEU/TEU"


In the event of a conflict, the AO chord serves the same purpose as the asterisk in normal steno.  

compounds ending in "thing" use the 'ing' suffix stroke.
